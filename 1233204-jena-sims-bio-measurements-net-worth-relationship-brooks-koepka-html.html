She graduated from this institution in 2007. She was a cheerleader in high school. Afterwards, she enrolled at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Belmont University</a>. In this university that is located in Nashville, Tennessee, she pursued a course in International Business for a short while.</p><h2>Career trail</h2><p class=align-left>Jena Sims joined the world of pageantry when she was still a teenager. In 2004, she enrolled and won the Miss Georgia National Teenage Competition. Her win earned her the title of Miss Georgia Junior National Teenager. In 2005, she was honoured as the Miss Junior National Teenager. Both these wins motivated her to join more pageantry competitions. On the 11th of November 2006, she was crowned <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Miss Georgia Teen USA</a> 2007. This was after a fierce competition that was held in Newman. Being the new queen who reigned after Brittany Sharp motivated her more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0918a42ef6ea3c14.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Courtney Thorne-Smith bio: Amazing facts about the Melrose Place star</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/25e2881c20f2f2fb.jpg><p class=align-left>In her new role and title, she was expected to place in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2007 Miss Teen USA</a> as the sole Georgia representative. Due to unexplained reasons, she decided not to participate in the show but was in attendance. She made a record of being the first Miss Georgia Teen USA not to be in the pageant from 2003. This period of being recognised by many people inspired her to be a philanthropist. She later slowed down on pageantry and focused more on helping the needy in society.</p><p class=align-left>Besides modelling, Sims is also a good actress. She moved to Sherman Oaks, California to pursue both acting and modelling. So far, she has appeared in a few films. Her debut into the film industry was in the 2012 movie <i>Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader</i> where she played Cassie, a leading role. She later appeared in one episode <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of <i>Entourage</i></a>. She also featured in <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Last Vegas</a></i> in 2013 and <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kill the Messenger </a></i>in 2014.

She has mainly focused on allowing children from resource-poor or disadvantaged settings to be part of pageantry shows. The organisation <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pageant of Hope</a>, which she founded, has been making a positive impact on society. It often organises and hosts beauty pageants for children who are sick from cancer and other disabilities. The shows have, so far, been held in various states such as California, New York and Michigan.</p><p class=align-left>Her efforts to put genuine smiles on the faces of these children have earned her accolades from Nestlé and Caring Institute. Sims has also won the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Prudential Spirit of Community</a> Prize as well as the Southern Hero reward. Her organisation, Pageant of Hope, has also received several National Community Rewards.</p><h2>Jena Sims net worth</h2><p class=align-left>From her modelling and acting career, Sims has amassed riches.

Before their romantic relationship was publicly known, Sims did not receive much attention from the media. Koepka is a renowned professional golf player who often appears in the media. Being Koepka girlfriend seems to be suitable for Sims because the two appear to be a very happy couple. The attention she has been receiving from being associated with the golfer is presumed to have earned her more modelling jobs. The couple began dating in 2017.</p><h2>Controversies and rumours</h2><p class=align-left>In 2012, stories started circulating that the lady was dating <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Buckley</a> whom she had met during her pageantry days. Neither she nor Buckley faced the public with denying or confirming these allegations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/88fbbd6d734b596f.jpg><h2>Hobbies and interests</h2><p class=align-left>In her free time, Sims enjoys fishing and swimming.
