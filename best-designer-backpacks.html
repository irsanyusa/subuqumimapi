Who hasn’t gone on a weekend trip and used a travel backpack? But if you want to get fancy, it’s all about a designer backpack instead of a designer handbag because you can carry so much more. Yes, I did say “designer backpack.” They’ve been around for a few years and have progressed from being a trendy item to a wardrobe essential.</p><h2 id=our-top-designer-backpack-picks>Our top designer backpack picks</h2><h3>Best affordable designer backpack: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Radley London Pocket Essentials Medium Ziptop Backpack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable designer backpack</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Radley London Pocket Essentials Medium Ziptop Backpack</h3></p><p>Radley London prides itself on being a luxury brand that offers stellar products with equally stellar price points.

This extra mini-sized backpack is their shrunken-down version of the classic Stark backpack. Both the classic and the mini use MCM’s Lauretos monogram print.

Created in collaboration with Japanese designer Verdy, the designer has a fun retro vibe evoking disco skating parties and 80s cool. And it’s all due to the diagonal logo printed in a font that’s a nostalgic nod to that era. Swing it from one shoulder like you’re back in school, or adjust the padded straps and style it as a classic backpack.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% polyester</li><li>Dimensions: 12 inches x 16.5 inches x 6.69 inches</li><li>Color options: Red and off-white, black and white</li><li>Care: Wipe clean with a damp cloth</li><li>Style options: N/A</li><li>Price at publish: $470</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Padded laptop compartment</li><li>Two-way zipper fastener</li><li>Zippered exterior pocket</li><li>Open interior pocket</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Suited more for business casual offices or off-duty wear</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Kenzo created an unstuffy designer backpack that’s roomy and holds your laptop.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kenzo Kenzogram Backpack</a></p><h3>Most versatile designer backpack: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cole Haan Grand Ambition Convertible Leather Backpack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most versatile designer backpack</span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/slimages.macysassets.com/is/image/MCY/products/9/optimized/25596609_fpx.tif?op_sharpen=1&amp;amp;wid=700&amp;amp;hei=855&amp;amp;fit=fit" alt="Cole Haan Grand Ambition Convertible Leather Backpack" title="Cole Haan Grand Ambition Convertible Leather Backpack" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Cole Haan Grand Ambition Convertible Leather Backpack</h3></p><p>Since its inception, Cole Haan has been known for quality leather goods that last for generations and the Grand Ambition backpack is created with that same ethos.

Goldschmied left to create his luxury jeans company, and Rosso took over creative control in the mid-1980s. Diesel’s always been a fashion-forward company that elevates denim and weekend wear. Their graphic design backpack is a nod to graffiti and skateboard culture.

Bottega Veneta uses it in almost all its styles, the only variation is the size of the leather strips. While the look is distinctive, they’ve been classified as a quiet luxury brand—that is until recently. A few of their handbag styles have catapulted into it-bag status, and now everyone wants a BV bag.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Leather exterior, suede interior</li><li>Dimensions: 18.1 inches x 11.8 inches x 5.5 inches</li><li>Color options: Mud, Fondant, Black, Space, Ardoise</li><li>Care: Clean with soft dry cloth.

Gemi is one of the newest and most accessible luxury designers in the industry. All of the luxury brand’s goods are designed and created in Italy. Many bags have hand-stitched details and are created in a family-owned workshop. This convertible backpack is made with soft, buttery leather and quickly converts from a laptop bag to a shoulder bag. It’s big enough to carry a laptop, small toys, and snacks. The Laura Convertible Backpack looks good at the park and in the office. (And if you’re curious about <a rel=alternate href=#>travel backpacks for women</a>, you can read more about them in our guide.)</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Italian calf leather exterior with linen lining</li><li>Dimensions: 15.8 inches x 3.94 inches x 22.8 inches</li><li>Color options: Tan, Warm Gray, Navy, Black, Dark Burgundy</li><li>Care: Clean with soft dry cloth</li><li>Style options: N/A</li><li>Price at publish: $298</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Zippered top</li><li>Roomy interior</li><li>Multiple interior pockets</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Because it’s a convertible bag, the straps aren’t padded.</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>There is no need to switch bags from work to spending the day with little ones because this designer backpack is a glamorous workhorse.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>M.

When Alessandro Michele helmed the design house as its creative director, one of his missions was to honor the luxury brand’s heritage. He did that by mining the archives, and then revitalizing heritage designs or patterns and monograms. Sometimes all three elements were included in one design. All that work meant that a Gucci bag, any Gucci bag was instantly recognizable and coveted. For this large canvas designer backpack, Michele used the piston closure from Gucci’s Jackie 1961 shoulder bag, as well as the brand’s fabric stripe. The leather trim and straps are also a nod to Gucci’s classic styling.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Canvas exterior, linen lining, leather trim and straps</li><li>Dimensions: 12.6 inches x 16.2 inches x 7.5 inches</li><li>Color options: Brown/beige monogram</li><li>Care: Clean with soft dry cloth</li><li>Style options: Can be worn as a backpack or hand-carry tote bag</li><li>Price at publish: $3,250</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Adjustable straps</li><li>Secure closure</li><li>Roomy Interior</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Leather straps aren’t padded, and it is pricey</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This large Gucci backpack won’t look out of place in an office, the gym, traveling, or out and about on the weekend.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Gucci ‘Jackie 1961’ GG-Supreme Canvas Backpack</a></p><h3>Best large designer backpack: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Loewe Convertible Backpack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best large designer backpack</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Loewe Convertible Backpack</h3></p><p>Loewe, pronounced low-ah-way, is an established Spanish luxury brand. It sailed quietly through the world until they chose J.W. Anderson as their creative director. He sprinkled a little magic on the brand, and boom! It’s neck and neck with Gucci and Louis Vuitton in popularity. Anderson likes to play with shapes, creating uniquely designed bags and shoes. This large designer backpack slightly resembles a stingray. It has a comfortable mesh back and padded straps like a travel backpack. It unclips and turns into a double-handled duffel with a strap that can be slung over one shoulder.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Classic calfskin leather exterior, cotton lining</li><li>Dimensions: 19.7 inches x 15.7 inches x 7.9 inches</li><li>Color options: Winter Brown, Dark Gray, Black</li><li>Care: Clean with soft dry cloth</li><li>Style options: Backpack, shoulder, or hand carry</li><li>Price at publish: $3,150</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Holds a 13-inch laptop</li><li>Adjustable straps</li><li>Secure closure</li><li>Two side zippered pockets, one large zippered pocket</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Weighs a little over two pounds</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Loewe’s eye-catching design, quality construction, and ability to hold almost anything makes this a stellar choice as a work or weekend backpack.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Loewe Convertible Backpack</a></p><h3>Best leather designer backpack: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rebecca Minkoff Jumbo Julian Backpack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best leather designer backpack</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Rebecca Minkoff Jumbo Julian Backpack</h3></p><p>Rebecca Minkoff’s eponymous line of bags has been around for over 20 years. Her rise was meteoric. In the early aughts, everyone wore her little crossbody bag. That style, a mix of boho chic and urban sophistication, cemented her reputation. The designer sends out smart-looking, sophisticated shoes and bags each season. Her Jumbo Julian Backpack is a larger version of the Julian Backpack and it’s just as chic. It has a cleverly placed laptop sleeve at the back of the backpack and a front center zipper that makes finding things a breeze.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Leather exterior, material lining</li><li>Dimensions: 12 inches x 17 inches x 6.5 inches</li><li>Color options: Caramello with antique brass hardware, Black with antique brass hardware, Black with black shellac hardware</li><li>Care: Clean with soft dry cloth</li><li>Style options: Backpack, shoulder, or hand carry</li><li>Price at publish: $428</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Lots of zippered pockets, inside and out</li><li>Adjustable straps</li><li>Can be used as an everyday bag, or to stow belongings for a weekend trip</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Looks a little bulky</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Because the interior is spacious, Minkoff’s Jumbo Julian Backpack holds a laptop and more.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rebecca Minkoff Jumbo Julian Backpack</a></p><h3>Best nylon designer backpack: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Prada Re-Nylon Drawstring Recycled Nylon Backpack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best nylon designer backpack</span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.selfridges.com/is/image/selfridges/R04268297_BLACK_M?wid=476&amp;amp;hei=634&amp;amp;fmt=webp&amp;amp;qlt=80" alt="Prada Re-Nylon Drawstring Recycled Nylon Backpack" title="Prada Re-Nylon Drawstring Recycled Nylon Backpack" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Prada Re-Nylon Drawstring Recycled Nylon Backpack</h3></p><p>This nylon backpack is the latest iteration of Miuccia Prada’s classic nylon backpack—the one that started it all.

I compared many of them, then narrowed down the ones that would look good in any activity or setting. Unless otherwise noted, all the backpacks selected are unisex.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-a-designer-backpack>How to choose a designer backpack?</h2><p>When purchasing a designer backpack, many factors come into play. What type of bag are you looking for—mini, graphic print, logo, or maybe sleek leather? There are so many different types of designer backpacks you could get lost admiring them all. Let’s review a few things to keep in mind when picking out your new bag.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>A designer backpack, or any bag, should work with you, not against you. If you carry a laptop or tablet, look for work bags with a padded compartment. Do you bike to work, drive, or take mass transit? These things factor into the type of backpack you use. Lightweight backpacks are best for biking or running errands. A designer backpack with multiple compartments keeps you organized. Graubard reminds us, "Some backpacks are really a style of handbag, best for work or running around town for the day. Other backpacks are utility pieces, like for travel or the gym.”</p><h3>Personal style</h3><p>We all have our own personal style. Do you lean into classic clothing, or are you a trendsetter? Have you ever met a graphic tee that you didn’t take home? We all curate what we own, and that same discernment should come into play when shopping for a designer backpack. Whether you’re on your first designer bag or your 90th, look for ones that fit and feel like “you.” When I asked Graubard how she knew a designer backpack would work for her, she told me, “The right bag will feel like you own it the minute you hold it, and it will elevate any outfit.”</p><h3>Use</h3><p>Is the designer backpack you’ve been eyeing replacing an older bag in your rotation? Are you looking for a bag to wear to work, or want to upgrade your travel game? Before you slap your credit card on the counter, step back and decide how often it will leave home with you. If you’re torn between a trendy backpack and a classic style, Graubard suggests sticking with timeless styles from the famed designers: Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Montblanc, Goyard, Givenchy, etc.</p><h3>Cost-to-use ratio</h3><p>No one likes to think about cost versus use; it’s hard to separate want from need, right? Here’s the thing: If you’ve fallen head over heels with a designer backpack and are contemplating purchasing it, ask yourself why. When chatting with Graubard, I mentioned to her that some people purchase designer items like they do stocks. She told me, “Designer bags are worth the investment, not only because of resale value but because they are often carried every day, as opposed to an expensive piece of clothing that may only be worn occasionally. A classic designer bag, well cared for, can be carried for 20 years or more. Also, if the bag is authentic, most brands will repair it, no matter how old it is.”</p><p>One thing to consider as you’re calculating your cost-to-use ratio: Designer bags, especially from particularly in-demand brands (especially Maison Margiela), often sell out fast once they are released. If you debate too long, you may miss out on the bag you want.</p><h2 id=how-did-designer-backpacks-become-a-thing>How did designer backpacks become a thing?</h2><p>To find out why designer backpacks have become a popular <a rel=alternate href=#>work bag for women</a> and why men use them for commuting, I chatted with trend analyst and fashion historian Sharon Graubard, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>SG Files</a>, a trend forecasting firm. “Prada’s first cult bag was a nylon backpack in 1984, a few years after Miuccia Prada took over her family’s iconic leather goods company,” she says. That designer backpack was named the “Vela” and is still available. Prada also brought back leggings and Y2K fashion and used street style for inspiration. If one designer creates a buzz-worthy item, other designers hop on the trend. That’s why you’ll see designer backpacks at every price point.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-basic-differences-between-a-designerluxury-backpack-and-a-non-designer-backpack>What are the basic differences between a designer/luxury backpack and a non-designer backpack?</h2><p>Construction is the crucial difference between a designer backpack and a non-designer one. Much like a <a rel=alternate href=#>designer handbag</a>, the materials are high-end, the stitching is neater, and numerous small details make a designer backpack an elevated item. As they age, the leather develops a soft patina and becomes even softer. When asked why designer backpacks differ from regular backpacks, Graubard explains, “The handles or straps will feel good in the hand and against the body.” She adds, “I have owned designer bags (or clothing, for that matter) for years before discovering a secret pocket or hidden functionality, like an adjustable closure.”</p><h2 id=speaking-of-assets-can-a-designer-bag-be-a-smart-financial-investment>Speaking of assets, can a designer bag be a smart financial investment?</h2><p>Yes, but choose classic styles, or desirable limited-edition collaborations, like Vuitton x Supreme—Louis Vuitton Christopher Backpack Limited Edition Supreme Epi Leather PM, for example,” Graubard says. She suggests visiting resale sites like 1stDibs, Grailed, Rebag, or TheRealReal to research resale values.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>What is a designer backpack?</h3><p>Designer backpacks are created by well-known fashion designers or brands. They’re made with quality materials and are sometimes hand-made. They come in a variety of styles, sizes and colors.

Designer backpacks are considered status symbols.</p><h3>What designer backpacks do celebrities wear?</h3><p>Like us, celebrities carry <a rel=alternate href=#>travel backpacks</a> and designer backpacks, switching up the type of bag depending on their activities. Armani White, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jamie Foxx, Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, and Paloma Faith are just a few who carry MCM's logo backpack on and off the red carpet. Madison Beers owns Fendi and Chanel backpacks. The Kardashian-Jenner clan has designer backpacks that include Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel.

Bachelorette Lauren Bushnell carried a Chloe backpack to a recent press event. Nick Jonas, Taylor Swift, Adam Scott, Brad Pitt, and Jake Gyllenhaal also sport designer backpacks.</p><h3>What are the best designer backpack brands?</h3><p>It’s hard to pinpoint the best because there are a lot of luxury brands and designers. Prices can range from under a hundred dollars to quadruple digits. Graubard suggests sticking to Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Chanel, Goyard, and The Row. However, you can find stellar backpacks from Givenchy, Maison Margiela, Balenciaga, and many other luxury brands. In the end, if you’re in love with a designer backpack, that brand is the best.</p><h3>What is the most expensive backpack in the world?</h3><p>Believe it or not, the most expensive backpack in the world changes quickly because you only hear about them when they’re on auction or offered as a limited edition item. One of the most expensive backpacks on sale now is a handmade crocodile backpack from Stefano Ricci. Accessorized with galvanized gold hardware, it’s on sale for $23,450, and you can buy it <a rel=nofollow href=#>online</a>.</p><h3>Are designer backpacks worth the investment?</h3><p>Certain designer backpacks, at resale, can be sold for a higher price than the original retail price.

For example, Louis Vuitton works with artists who can customize your backpack with a hand-painted design. It’s best to contact the brand to find out what options they offer before purchasing the bag.</p><h3>Can I return or exchange a designer backpack if I don’t like it?</h3><p>Every designer brand has its own return, refund, and exchange policy. Some policies differ from country to country. It’s best to ask those questions to a sales associate (if shopping in person) or search for the information on the brand’s website before purchasing.</p><h3>Can I insure a designer backpack?</h3><p>Some homeowner’s and renter’s insurance plans include property protection; check with your insurance company if you can add coverage via a rider or floater. Also check with your insurance company if you can add a supplemental insurance policy or if they have a luxury goods insurance policy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llJrAqrPNnqlmmpGYuLGtwqSqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./episcopal-turf-war.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Episcopal Turf War | TIME">&larr;
