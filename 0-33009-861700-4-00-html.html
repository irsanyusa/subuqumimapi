As Playwright John van Druten puts it: "Onstage she is a flame, but as she leaves it she turns into a wisp of smoke." Not since Maude Adams has a famous actress cherished such a private private life. She and her husband. Stage Manager Manning Gurian. manage to live in midtown Manhattan, not ten blocks off Broadway, as quietly as two deaf theater mice in a kettledrum. They seldom go out, seldom entertain. Julie does the housework when she doesn't have a play, and takes care of the baby, Peter, who is four months old; Manning does a fair share of the cooking. "I'd like to lead a glamorous life," she says, "but it tires me out." As it is, she scarcely drinks four shots of whisky in a year, and a taxi ride is almost like a spree. She has no jewelry, no furs. She still wears some blouses that she bought in high school. The spice of her life is a window-shopping walk down Fifth Avenue.</p><p>Strong Light. The plain life expresses some remarkably solid virtues. She burns continuously with what a friend calls "unmitigated sincerity." She loves or she hates; she gives everything or nothing. She is a one-man woman with a one-track mind. The theater is her religion and she serves it like a vestal. She has almost no material concerns. "She would work 20 hours a day for $20 a week if I didn't watch out," her husband says. It is hard for her to tell a lie, and she blazes in defense of the truth as she sees it.</p><p>So strong a light must necessarily cast a strong shadow; and Julie, so her friends think, has been too much afraid of the dark in human life for a grown-up girl. She agrees. "I haven't got a good capacity for suffering. I crack too quickly under the stress of it. I give up and I go away from what is hurting me. I don't want a life of continual fighting. I have a longing for peace. I wish I had more fight, but when I fight I lose my work -the feeling goes out of it."</p><p>In the last year, since her second marriage, Julie's roots in real life are better fed, and the vital shapes of a permanent feeling and experience are filling her child face. She no longer lives so one-sidedly, and is beginning to accept her weaknesses as well as her strengths. As a result, she makes fewer strict rules for herself and sets fewer standards for others. Her innocence of the world is warming to a womanly kind of realism.</p><p>Sometimes, though, fed up with her good-girl reputation. Julie has a tomboy temptation to bitch it up a little. She can use a four-letter word when she has to; and one day when a shapely young actress was making her usual bid for attention, Julie sneered: "Oh, if I had a bosom, I could rule the world!" Says Julie: "I really hate to be well-bred!" The fact is, she has little choice in the matter.</p><p>Julia Ann Harris was born Dec. 2, 1925, well on the right side of the Detroit tracks. Her father, an investment banker, was a rich man by inheritance and a scholar by nature. Her mother, a girl from Jersey City, is described as "a charming and soignee woman." The family was conservative, but there was a theatrical taint in the blood. Julie's great-grandfather had a longing to tread the boards, but mounted the pulpit instead. He became the second Episcopal bishop of Michigan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1fqMKjv8KroJudomSus8DInKOeZ2BhgHR8j3JjcW5hbH1xeZNlZ2lmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vault.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The TIME Magazine Vault">&larr;
