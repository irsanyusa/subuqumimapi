post-container"><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JAKE BAKER DOESN’T look like the kind of guy who would tie a woman by her hair to a ceiling fan. The slight (5 ft. 6 in., 125 lbs.), quiet, bespectacled sophomore at the University of Michigan is described by classmates as gentle, conscientious and introverted. His high school librarian, his 4-H adviser, the mother of the children for whom he baby-sat in Boardman, Ohio, all stand ready to attest to his moral fitness. At the university, where he majors in linguistics, he maintained a 3.2 average. Until two weeks ago, he’d never been accused of harming anyone. “I don’t like stepping on insects,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Baker has been doing a little creative writing lately, and his words have landed him in the middle of the latest Internet set-to, one that pits a writer’s First Amendment guarantees of free speech against a reader’s right to privacy. Now Baker is facing expulsion and a possible sentence of five years on federal charges of sending threats over state lines.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It started in early December, when Baker composed three sexual fantasies and posted them on alt.sex.stories, a newsgroup on the Usenet computer network that is distributed via the Internet. Even by the standards of alt.sex.stories, which is infamous for explicit depictions of all sorts of sex acts, Baker’s material is strong stuff. Women (and young girls) in his stories are kidnapped, sodomized, mutilated and left to die by men who exhibit no remorse. Baker even seemed to take pleasure in the behavior of his protagonists and the suffering of their victims. “Torture is foreplay,” he wrote in the introduction to one of his pieces. “Rape is romance, snuff is climax.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The story that got Baker in trouble featured, in addition to the ceiling fan, acts performed with superglue, a steel-wire whisk, a metal clamp, a spreader bar, a hot curling iron and, finally, a match. Ordinarily, the story might never have drawn attention outside the voyeuristic world of Usenet sex groups. But Baker gave his fictional victim the name of a real female student in one of his classes. When university officials were alerted (by an alumnus who spotted the story on a computer in, of all places, Moscow), they gave Baker a psychological evaluation and had him escorted off campus, apparently out of concern that he might be a danger to the community-not to mention the female student.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unfortunately for Baker, the Michigan campus is well versed in the latest academic debate over where sexual fantasy turns into sexual abuse. Catharine MacKinnon, author of Only Words and a professor at the law school, is the nation’s foremost proponent of the theory that writing and reading pornography are in themselves acts of violence; that consumers of it end up, depending on their “chosen sphere of operation,” raping, abusing or discriminating against women. MacKinnon immediately seized on Baker’s case. “What he wrote constitutes libel, sexual harassment and is a violation of privacy,” she says. “We need a law that addresses what is done to women through pornography.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some members of Congress apparently agree. Democratic Senator James Exon of Nebraska introduced legislation earlier this month calling for two-year prison terms for anyone who sends-or knowingly makes available-obscene material over an electronic medium. “I want to keep the information superhighway from resembling a red-light district,” Exon says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But civil libertarians fear the proposed law could turn every online-service provider into an info cop. “Exon’s bill would be the end of the Internet as we know it,” says Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, a New York City-based media-research firm. Mike Godwin, staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argues that constitutional guarantees apply in the new media just as they apply in the old-no matter how offensive the material. “The First Amendment was designed to protect offensive speech, because no one ever tries to ban the other kind,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the Ann Arbor campus, opinion on Baker is divided. “If he’s a threat, I’d rather have this taken care of quickly,” says senior Kathryn Jesudowich. The Michigan Student Assembly, on the other hand, issued a resolution condemning the university. Then on Thursday, half an hour before his disciplinary hearing was set to begin, fbi agents arrested Baker under a federal statute that prohibits interstate transmission of a threat to kidnap or injure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview with Time before he was taken into custody, Baker insisted that he never meant to hurt anyone and had never even spoken to the woman. “I could have made up a name, but I didn’t,” he said. “I used hers because it was on the top of my mind.” He says the violence he expressed was a product of stress. “This would not have got written had I not been fearful about my future at the university. I had a lot of anxiety about my student loan,” he says. Baker is anxious about coming back to school, and insists he will pursue psychological counseling even if the university does not require it. But above all, he wants to be a writer-the kind who gets noticed. “The worst insult to a writer is for people to have no opinion about his work,” he says. His newest plot line: “a guy who has been wronged by society and is out for revenge.” By the time this case is sorted out, he should have plenty of material.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">–Reported by Wendy Cole/Chicago</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ua25obIVwv82unZ9loKS%2Fr3nOp2StoJViu6bAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gene-tuning-power-essay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Power and Potential of Gene Tuning">&larr;
