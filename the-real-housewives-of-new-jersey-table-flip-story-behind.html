And no moment has shaped the <i>Housewives</i> universe more definitively than when <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> flipped a fully loaded dinner table in a fit of rage in the 2009 season 1 finale of <i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i>.</p><p>Although the table-flip moment has become an indelible part of the blueprint followed by many aspiring reality stars who lean into belligerence as a way to get attention—one previously popularized by the women of <i>Bad Girls Club </i>and confrontational daytime talk shows like <i>Jerry Springer</i>—it came as a truly shocking twist during the season finale of a franchise extension that viewers were still unsure about. <a href=#>Giudice</a>, who had been depicted for most of the season as a sweet and devoted wife, mother, and satellite to the Manzo family around whom much of the drama revolved, was in the middle of hosting a dinner party at a local restaurant. The cast’s villain, Danielle Staub, confronted the other women for gossiping about her past by placing a copy of <i>Cop Without a Badge</i>, a damning book about her ex-husband, on the table. When a heated argument about the origin of the rumors broke out, Giudice reached her boiling point. She shoved her hands beneath the table and flipped it, screaming, “Prostitution whore!” at her castmate.</p><p>Carlos King, now the CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a longtime producer of <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey </i>and <a href=#><i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i></a>, was on set when it happened. More than a decade later, he says he knew in that moment that the scene would make a lasting impact. “I knew that it was going to be cemented in our pop-culture history,” King says. “Think about it: 13 years later, it’s still something we’re talking about.”</p><p><b>Read More</b>: <a href=#><i>Reality TV Has Reshaped Our World, Whether We Like It or Not</i></a></p><p>King, then an associate producer on the show, has a unique perspective on the incident: he had been underneath the table in question earlier the same night, holding onto the book for Staub, because she was wearing a dress too tight to conceal it. King handed the book to her and set the events in motion—a prime example of the <a href=#>behind-the-scenes orchestration</a> that goes into <a href=#>reality TV moments</a> that are meant to play out as spontaneous and organic. According to King, what the finished episode didn’t show was that after the book was placed on the table (and after he crawled out from underneath it), the other women refused to talk about it for 20 minutes—until Staub, annoyed with the avoidance, forced the subject and incited the table flip heard ‘round the world. King describes the moment as so cinematic that it felt like something out of a Scorsese film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/table_flip_1.gif?w=600"><p>He and the rest of the production staff weren’t the only ones shaken by Giudice’s outburst. Following the end of the shoot, which went on for another hour, a nervous Giudice called King for feedback on the scene. “Teresa called me en route to her house and asked, ‘What did you think?’” King recalls. “I said, ‘Oh, honey, mark my words: you’re going to be an <i>icon</i>.’”</p><p>There was some truth to that statement. The table-flip moment changed not only the course of Giudice’s career as a reality star, but also the trajectory of <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey, </i>all the <i>Housewives</i> spin-offs, and even reality TV more broadly. “No one really saw Teresa emerging as the star of the show,” King says, “but because of that exchange, we all knew that Teresa was going to have a long career in this business.” At that point in the franchise, with only the Orange County, New York, and <a href=#>Atlanta</a> shows up and running, there had never been a truly memorable, standout moment of drama from a <i>Housewives</i> season.</p><p><b>Read More</b>: <a href=#><i>The 50 Most Influential Reality TV Seasons of All Time</i></a></p><p>The way Giudice’s outburst thrust her into the reality TV spotlight immediately took on an aspirational glimmer for fellow <a href=#><i>Housewives</i></a> cast members and other reality TV contenders seeking their 15 minutes of fame. From Tamra Judge throwing wine in another woman’s face on season 6 of <i>The Real Housewives of Orange County </i>to Monique Samuel’s hair-pulling fight with Candiace Dillard on season 5 of <i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of Potomac, </i>Giudice’s influence on the behavior of women in the franchise is clear. The most direct example of her impact may be the belligerent persona constructed by <a href=#><i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i> star Jen Shah</a>, who, after taking part in a fight at a luncheon table on the show, tweeted in September 2020 that “Teresa walked, so I could run.” (That Shah would later be charged with fraud, like Giudice was in 2013, was an odd coincidence.)</p><p>And even outside of the Bravo universe, Giudice’s outburst has infiltrated pop culture, with <a href=#><i>30 Rock</i> parodying the incident</a> in 2011, and <i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> fans suggesting that she was the inspiration for a <a href=#>heated table-flip scene</a> in season 2 of Netflix’s scripted comedy <i>Emily in Paris</i>. From drunk and hostile suitors on <a href=#><i>The</i> <i>Bachelorette</i></a> to the quick-to-slap stars of <a href=#><i>Vanderpump Rules</i></a>, reality TV personalities seeking lasting fame have long leaned on aggressive behavior to get attention. If Giudice’s legacy is in encouraging this approach, it’s not necessarily a positive one—but there’s no denying its impact.</p><p>King argues that Giudice’s performance can never be replicated: “A lot of people are trying to have their table-flip moment. They feel like they need to rise to that occasion—and they always fail.” Her authenticity, he says, is why she’s the last original member of <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> still on the show after 13 years. “A lot of people want to be the Teresa of their franchise,” King says. “But she wasn’t trying to mimic anybody. She did that because that’s who she is.”</p><p>More Must-Reads from TIME</p><p class=author-feedback-text><strong>Contact us</strong> at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">letters@time.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaKqVlrmqwNhmq69lnaTAtXnIp52lrZWjwaqty2aqnpmjpLu0e5VqcHBvaG18tbTEZqmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoynnLBlmpq%2FtLHYZquampyaeqe4yKlkrKyfp8ZursShoKecXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trains-intercites-un-collectif-appelle-les-elus-au-sursaut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="un collectif appelle les lus au &amp;quot;sursaut&amp;quot;">&larr;
