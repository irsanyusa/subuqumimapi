The mark he broke was Avilov’s. Last month at the U.S. Olympic trials, despite relatively weak performances in the shotput and pole vault, Jenner scored 8,538 points and broke the record again. No one else has ever topped 8,500 points. Avilov, meanwhile, has had limited competition since Munich; for a year he was without a coach, and last winter he strained a knee ligament, which slowed his training.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Avilov, 28, concedes that his Montreal face-off with Jenner, 26, will be “the toughest one of my life.” A lawyer and father of a three-year-old boy, Avilov credits himself with one big advantage: the maturity of an athlete who has already conquered gold fever. Says he: “When I was a kid I dreamed of becoming an Olympic champion in something, in anything. I mean literally dreamed. I could see that little piece of gold in my hand. Now I’ve got it. But Jenner, he’s too anxious to grab that medal away from me.” Says Jenner of Avilov’s composure: “He was so relaxed before the final event at Munich that he freaked me out. I would have been in a straitjacket myself.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After six years of running in the morning, lifting weights in the evening and working on technique in between, Jenner is eager to cash in on his training. A strikingly handsome man with chestnut hair, sparkling hazel eyes and a smile so toothsomely bright that it seems capable of tanning his exquisitely chiseled features, Jenner believes that a gold medal would ensure him lucrative advertising offers and possibly even a movie career. And if he wins the gold, Jenner, the son of a Connecticut tree surgeon, promises not to make the same mistake as Mark Spitz: “I’ll show personality.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">First, Jenner must prove that his balanced performance in the ten running, throwing, and jumping events that make up the taxing, two-day decathlon contest can overcome Avilov’s excellence in three. Powered by his heavily muscled legs, Avilov (6 ft. 3 in., 191 lbs.) is expected to outscore Jenner in the long jump, high jump and the 110-meter hurdles. Jenner (6 ft. 2 in., 195 lbs.), who is more supple, has an edge in the pole vault, 100 meters and 1,500 meters. The 400 meters could go to either. In the throwing events, which involve both strength and speed, the two are evenly matched.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because of the decathlon’s schedule, the duel may well provide one of the Olympics’ most electric moments. Avilov could have a substantial lead (150 to 200 points) after the first day’s five events, but then Jenner should come on strong. “I’ll be behind for nine events—it will be that close,” says Jenner. The last event, the 1,500, is a Jenner specialty. The question: Under the lights as the evening wears on, and after two grueling days of tension, can Jenner win his race by a big enough margin to win the gold as well?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Also decided by that time may be the second question: Who is the handsomer decathlon star? This too will be a close contest. “Have you ever seen a picture of Adam and Eve?” asks Avilov’s wife Valentina, a former Olympic high jumper. “Well, Nikolai is Adam.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbXBhZn5wv8%2Boqa1lpJq7bsDErKusZZakv27A1qhm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./israel-rising-settler-violence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Israeli Settler Attacks on Palestinians Are Increasing">&larr;
