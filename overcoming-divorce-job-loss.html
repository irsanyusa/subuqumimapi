An actress doesn’t get to do that often; we live in a world of auditions, rejections, <a href=#>unemployment</a> and <a href=#>odd jobs</a> while we wait for that big break. I was 31 when I was <a href=# rel=noopener>cast in Bullets Over Broadway</a>, a show that received a lot of promotion. I thought I would have a consistent job for at least the next five years. I had already spent a decade on the roller coaster that is working in theatre, but now I could finally relax. Maybe even <a href=#>have a baby</a>, or two! This was my fourth Broadway musical, so getting a closing notice was nothing new to me. But to hear, “the show is closing,” after only three months, stung.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the same time, I found my <a href=#>marriage unexpectedly and abruptly ending</a> after seven years. Just six months before it seemed like everything was about to fall into place, now everything was falling apart. I found myself in my thirties without a job, without a husband and without a plan. I had an overwhelming desire to take control of my life. I’d spent the last ten years having my happiness and my job determined by a row of casting directors in an audition room. I needed to <a href=#>do something for myself</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I had been teaching <a href=#>fitness</a> classes for the past few years as a way to get by in between shows. I had never planned for it to be more than that, but I quickly found it was something I loved doing. It felt like a performance being in front of a room of people dancing, so it oddly connected to my career and felt like home. Teaching became my <a href=#>therapy</a> through that tough time. I had to get in front of a class and have energy and a positive attitude for everyone else in the room. I got to blast music, put a smile on and be surrounded by a room full of energy and determination. It really helped me focus on something positive and <a href=#>relieve stress</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/amandakloots-therope.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After helping so many clients <a href=#>achieve their goals</a> and making relationships with so many amazing women, I realized this job was more than a hobby. I had created my own way of working out with a jump rope that I knew was unique. I saw how it was changing my body and decided I needed to start teaching it to my classes. So I took a leap — or jump — of faith and started my own business. My class, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Rope</a>, debuted at <a href=# rel=noopener>Studio B</a>, a workout space in New York City, in April 2016.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But despite great press, no one came to class at first. I would come home feeling defeated and trying to figure out why my class wasn’t resonating with people. I really believed in my workout, but the fitness world in New York is oversaturated with options and trainers. It was hard to get people to take a chance on something new.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But rejection was something I was used to from my past career. I was no stranger to perseverance, and I knew some things just take time. With a new time slot The Rope started to take off. Two people turned to four, four turned to ten, ten turned to twenty. Eight months in, classes were sold out with a waitlist. To this day when I stand in front of a group of women and men eager to skip rope with me, I get tears in my eyes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Life can definitely throw you some ups and downs, but one thing I’ve learned is how strong you become from the lowest times in your life. I found love again, have my own business and have turned into a woman I wouldn’t have recognized five years ago. Through it all, I’ve learned to believe in yourself when things seem unbelievable — that’s when you grow the most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamZnhXeCjqitnqqTpLqqusZmm6Kun6ewpnnJqJlmpJ%2BowHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./keivonn-woodard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keivonn Woodard: TIME's Kid of the Year List">&larr;
