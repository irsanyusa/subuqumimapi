This creature most likely has the biggest pair of&nbsp;eyes that has ever existed on&nbsp;our planet. They measure an&nbsp;astonishing 11&nbsp;inches across, which makes them the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c9/1a5/36654f507b85773dd2800eec59.png><p>The colossal squid needs such eyes not only to&nbsp;see its prey better but also to&nbsp;protect itself from underwater predators. Its eyes face forward, giving the squid binocular vision. Another type of&nbsp;squid, called the giant squid, has its eyes placed on&nbsp;each side of&nbsp;its head. This allows the animal to&nbsp;see predators, too. But since it&nbsp;lacks that binocular vision, it’s not very good at&nbsp;estimating distances. The colossal squid, like many other squid species, has a&nbsp;fascinating feature called light organs&nbsp;— one in&nbsp;each eyeball. Those light organs are made of&nbsp;vertical lines located in&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;their eyeballs. These organs are similar to&nbsp;the headlights of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car.</p><p>But even though the colossal squid has this really cool feature, it&nbsp;most likely doesn’t have color vision. Most deep-sea animals don’t, either. But it’s not like they need it&nbsp;that much in&nbsp;the depths of&nbsp;the ocean, where it&nbsp;gets really dark. Humans, for example, have eyes that can only detect light at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;about 1,600-2,000&nbsp;feet. Since colossal squid are found at&nbsp;more than 3,200 feet below the surface, they needed to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see in&nbsp;almost pitch-black darkness. That’s why they also have very large pupils, about 3&nbsp;inches across. It&nbsp;helps them collect every single particle of&nbsp;light in&nbsp;those harsh environments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4c8/db7/9f3ec65cb8aad506ab530fce77.png><p>Big eyes don’t necessarily mean big bodies; just ask tarsiers. They’re a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;primates that have the biggest eye-to-body size ratio. Each of&nbsp;their eyes is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;their brain. You can find these Gollum-looking animals in&nbsp;Southeast Asia. Because they have such big eyes, these small animals aren’t able to&nbsp;rotate them fully, so&nbsp;they have to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;their necks to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better field of&nbsp;vision. Similar to&nbsp;owls, their necks can rotate about 180 degrees on&nbsp;each side. Tarsiers are nocturnal animals and use these quirky-looking eyes to&nbsp;look for prey. They don’t put much effort apart from that&nbsp;— they just wait for the prey to&nbsp;approach them instead, sitting patiently in&nbsp;the dark.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;small but effective eyes, some types of&nbsp;dragonfly eyes come equipped with about 28,000 lenses&nbsp;— that’s more than in&nbsp;any other living animal. And since their peepers cover almost their entire head, they have a&nbsp;perfect 360-degree vision. But can an&nbsp;animal survive without eyelids? Most living beings have evolved to&nbsp;have eyelids to&nbsp;help protect their eyes from debris. Eyelids also help&nbsp;us in&nbsp;super-bright environments or&nbsp;when we&nbsp;are exposed to&nbsp;high heat. Last but certainly not least, eyelids help keep eyes lubricated so&nbsp;that they don’t dry out and lose their functions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/784/f26/06b7a2555b80004ab2f27e9cd5.png><p>Well, check out nocturnal geckos; they don’t have eyelids, but they came up&nbsp;with another unique method. They have to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;their tongues to&nbsp;keep their eyes lubricated and clean. They also see really well in&nbsp;dim light because, in&nbsp;the nighttime, their vision is&nbsp;350 times more sensitive to&nbsp;color than ours. I&nbsp;mean, I’d certainly love to&nbsp;have eyes that change color every now and then, but unfortunately for&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;wasn’t born an&nbsp;Arctic reindeer. Their eyes can switch colors depending on&nbsp;the season. In&nbsp;the summer, for example, their eyes turn gold, whilst during the colder months, they have blue eyes. These animals have adapted to&nbsp;have this color flexibility because of&nbsp;the ever-changing light levels in&nbsp;their harsh habitat.</p><p>Ever heard of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a> with four eyes? Its official name is&nbsp;Anableps, and it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;special ability to&nbsp;see both above and below the water line&nbsp;— simultaneously! How come? Because its eyes are split in&nbsp;half by&nbsp;a&nbsp;horizontal line. Each of&nbsp;those half-eyes comes with its own pupil and retina, which means they can act separately. This unique disposition of&nbsp;its eyes allows the fish to&nbsp;see both predators in&nbsp;the sky and spot insects on&nbsp;land&nbsp;— those make up&nbsp;for most of&nbsp;its menu.</p><p>Ostriches have eyes that are bigger than their brains! They also have the largest eyes out of&nbsp;all terrestrial animals since they measure about 2&nbsp;inches across. But if&nbsp;you look closely, you’ll also see that ostriches have eyes with long, dense “lashes.” They’re not really lashes, though, since they’re not made of&nbsp;hair. Those long strands are actually more related to&nbsp;feathers and help these huge birds with some added shade and protection against flying sand. Some of&nbsp;the best eyes out there are those of&nbsp;chameleons. They have the ability to&nbsp;move independently, which gives these reptiles almost 360-degree vision. The reptile can also use both monocular vision&nbsp;— that’s when both eyes function separately&nbsp;— and binocular vision&nbsp;— when both eyes focus on&nbsp;the same thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/36e/ffe/9ab69155328ed15ed045fa4bf2.png><p>California’s purple sea urchin is&nbsp;basically one single functioning eye! That’s because the whole surface of&nbsp;its body is&nbsp;filled with photoreceptors. That makes the sea urchin sensitive to&nbsp;light, which means it&nbsp;can see in&nbsp;every direction. It&nbsp;does need to&nbsp;focus the light for better vision once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while. The creature uses its spines to&nbsp;stop some of&nbsp;the light from hitting its body.</p><p>Some eyes in&nbsp;the animal kingdom needed to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;really hot climates. Like those of&nbsp;camels, for example. These animals have really long lashes that help them keep away the sand. A&nbsp;camel’s eye also features a&nbsp;third eyelid. But this one sweeps across from the corner of&nbsp;each eye. Because their environment is&nbsp;filled with small particles of&nbsp;dust, they need to&nbsp;clean their eyes more frequently than other species.</p><p>Owls have eyes that share one great feature with those of&nbsp;humans. They can see in&nbsp;3D&nbsp;— much like any other predators. Owls need this to&nbsp;better calculate the distance toward their prey. But here comes the problem: how do&nbsp;those gigantic eyes fit into the small skull of&nbsp;an&nbsp;owl? Turns out that these birds had to&nbsp;“redesign” their eye shape. An&nbsp;owl’s eye is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;sphere; it’s more elongated. The bones in&nbsp;the bird’s skull have a&nbsp;special structure called a&nbsp;sclerotic ring. It&nbsp;helps support these huge eyes and hold them in&nbsp;place. But because of&nbsp;these rings, owls can’t rotate their eyes, which are always looking straight ahead. Instead, they have to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;their necks to&nbsp;see around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c4f/a41/ba67a35678affd1b00a32dec97.png><p>The mantis shrimp has probably the most complex eyes in&nbsp;the entire animal kingdom. Us&nbsp;humans have only three types of&nbsp;cones in&nbsp;our eyes&nbsp;— this gives&nbsp;us the ability to&nbsp;see the colors red through violet. The mantis shrimp has 16&nbsp;types of&nbsp;cones! They might not see different colors from those we&nbsp;do, but they do&nbsp;have one of&nbsp;the best color recognition systems out there. These extreme color receptors allow them to&nbsp;react to&nbsp;every small change in&nbsp;hue really fast, avoiding predators.</p><p>When you think about animals with really unique peepers, sheep and goats aren’t the first on&nbsp;your list, right? Don’t dismiss them so&nbsp;quickly, though, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;goat’s pupils are shaped like horizontal lines&nbsp;— and that comes with its own purpose. Data provided by&nbsp;researchers points out that pupil shape and eye orientation are related to&nbsp;the daily activities of&nbsp;each type of&nbsp;animal. Take bigger daytime predators, like wolves, for example: most of&nbsp;them have forward-facing eyes and round pupils.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d5d/441/8ef3085a5fb6d2528e9492e7ac.png><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, smaller animals, like snakes, cats, or&nbsp;foxes that go&nbsp;to&nbsp;look for food both during the day and at&nbsp;night, come with vertical slit pupils, better adapted for night vision. More vulnerable animals, like horses and deer, need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;constantly on&nbsp;their toes.</p><p>So&nbsp;they’ve adapted to&nbsp;have wide and narrow horizontal pupils. This allows them to&nbsp;stretch their field of&nbsp;vision, which is&nbsp;wider than that of&nbsp;any other animal. Also, when they keep their head low, their eyes rotate, and they keep a&nbsp;watch on&nbsp;their surroundings.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLK6sYysoLOdXZi8rrzAq6Csp55iwamxjLCcoqqUmsC1ecSynKxlmaN6tbTEZpinoZ2WuW63yKeenaedYoVygZZwbWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-woods-oppenheimer-producer-credit-secret-trump-support-1236086272.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Woods Says Oppenheimer EP Credit Was Kept Quiet After It Was Suggested His P">&larr;
