She’s <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> and has a&nbsp;small daughter, who’s in&nbsp;contact with the woman’s ex-husband and his new girlfriend. Everything was fine, up&nbsp;until one day, when the mom revealed a&nbsp;detail about her daughter’s <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> with her ex-husband’s SO. The woman considered this behavior very inappropriate and even shocking, so, she wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter, asking our readers for their opinions about this situation.</p><p><h2>Vanessa parted ways with her husband a&nbsp;year ago.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/311/910/018a4359308d955139e175bc87.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Vanessa, 35, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and all she wanted was to&nbsp;get as&nbsp;many opinions as&nbsp;she could about her very complex situation. The woman thinks she has a&nbsp;full right of&nbsp;feeling angry about what happened to&nbsp;her little daughter. On&nbsp;the other hand, she doesn’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;any harm and hurt anyone’s feelings with her reaction.</p><p>The woman opened her letter, saying, “My&nbsp;husband Josh and&nbsp;I split a&nbsp;year ago. Our divorce was of&nbsp;that kind, when other people could even get envious of&nbsp;how smoothly and delicately we&nbsp;made everything happen. In&nbsp;fact, none of&nbsp;us had feelings for each other anymore, and we&nbsp;lived together only for the sake of&nbsp;our little daughter, Miranda. But soon, we&nbsp;both wanted to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;new <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, with other people, and we&nbsp;both felt it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;turn the page of&nbsp;our marriage.”</p><p>Vanessa revealed, “We&nbsp;both put a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;ensure that our divorce wouldn’t take a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;our daughter Miranda. Both of&nbsp;us have been spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with the kid, participating in&nbsp;all her activities and making her the Queen of&nbsp;our souls, just like it&nbsp;was before. Miranda is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very smart little girl, we&nbsp;know she did understand that something was happening between&nbsp;us, but as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;our behavior towards her didn’t change, she was quite relaxed about the whole thing.”</p><p><h2>Both spouses entered a&nbsp;new relationship with other people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2e/ab8/04704b5e27b9555f7f485dc25d.jpg><p>Vanessa goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “I&nbsp;am now dating a&nbsp;man, Frank, who’s not introduced to&nbsp;Miranda yet. I&nbsp;just decided to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;little bit before I&nbsp;do it, because&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;make sure that everything is&nbsp;serious between&nbsp;us.<br>My&nbsp;ex&nbsp;also has a&nbsp;girlfriend, they’ve been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship for 5&nbsp;months. I&nbsp;haven’t met her in&nbsp;person, but Miranda does visit them, and&nbsp;I didn’t have any objections about their communication. On&nbsp;the contrary, I&nbsp;was happy that they bonded to&nbsp;such an&nbsp;extent that Miranda was praising Kylie (the girlfriend) and she does like her.”</p><p>Vanessa explained, “To&nbsp;make things even more clear, I&nbsp;was genuinely happy that my&nbsp;daughter has another wonderful woman in&nbsp;her life. I&nbsp;also wanted to&nbsp;meet Kylie in&nbsp;person one day and express my&nbsp;gratitude to&nbsp;her for being such a&nbsp;wonderful person and for her attitude to&nbsp;our daughter. I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;jealousy, I’m absolutely relaxed about this woman being in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;and my&nbsp;daughter. But one thing did make me&nbsp;angry and disappointed.”</p><p><h2>Vanessa discovered an&nbsp;unpleasant thing about her daughter’s communication with the girlfriend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/936/907/8a6e4d5bd08ddd88d5407b0deb.jpg><p>Vanessa continues her story, saying, “Miranda often visits her dad and Kylie, and she adores spending time with them. Her dad comes to&nbsp;pick her up&nbsp;3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;week, sometimes even more often. I&nbsp;always know where they’ve been together and what they’ve done, this is&nbsp;important for&nbsp;me, and my&nbsp;ex-husband knows about this, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;tells me&nbsp;about their activities and Miranda adds up&nbsp;some nice details, too.”</p><p>The woman shared, “I&nbsp;know that Kylie would sometimes take care of&nbsp;Miranda in&nbsp;many ways, like combing her hair or&nbsp;buying her some lingerie. I&nbsp;was okay with that. But last week, Miranda went to&nbsp;visit them and when she came home, I&nbsp;could see that something was wrong with the kid.”</p><p>Vanessa revealed, “When I&nbsp;asked Miranda, very carefully, what happened to&nbsp;her and why she was so&nbsp;sad, she told me&nbsp;that she lost her rubber duckling and that’s why she was so&nbsp;disappointed. I&nbsp;asked her why she ever took her rubber duckling to&nbsp;her dad’s place, because this duckling was meant only for taking baths and showers, this was my&nbsp;little daughter’s habit. But, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew, she didn’t take it&nbsp;anywhere except to&nbsp;the shower.<br>And this was the moment when Miranda told me&nbsp;that Kylie bathed her. And this happened many times, and this time they lost her duckling somewhere in&nbsp;Kylie’s bathroom.”</p><p><h2>Vanessa is&nbsp;appalled at&nbsp;the incident and she wants to&nbsp;express her opinion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14d/a47/ad98b55e89a35ca33a901803c3.jpg><p>Vanessa wrote, “I’m furious at&nbsp;the fact that Kylie bathed my&nbsp;daughter. What makes me&nbsp;even more angry is&nbsp;the fact that she did it&nbsp;multiple times. So, this was not an&nbsp;emergency, this was the normal thing in&nbsp;her relationship with my&nbsp;infant daughter. I&nbsp;feel totally weird about this. I&nbsp;believe that this circumstance is&nbsp;inappropriate and a&nbsp;boundary of&nbsp;bathing my&nbsp;child unless in&nbsp;emergency circumstances needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;set.”</p><p>The woman said, “I’m extremely supportive of&nbsp;Kylie being involved in&nbsp;any other less intimate aspects while communicating with our child, but&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;openly express my&nbsp;concerns and forbid her to&nbsp;bathe Miranda. Do&nbsp;you think I&nbsp;am overreacting? Should I&nbsp;express my&nbsp;thoughts to&nbsp;my&nbsp;ex-husband or&nbsp;Kylie directly, or&nbsp;should&nbsp;I ignore the whole thing and pretend that&nbsp;I don’t care? What would you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoes?”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;confession from a&nbsp;woman, who appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;married man’s <a href=#>lover</a>, and she ruined his family. She expected a&nbsp;paradise in&nbsp;her relationship with her&nbsp;SO, but now she revealed why it&nbsp;all turned into one huge nightmare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecSxZKGto5eur7DSZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1ksJ2eqXq1u85mnZqqXZ67br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2auoqyYYry2voyloK2snJp6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJitm6tzGadrqWZo7RuhJBxb3JtXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sian-fuller-sparks-sibling-rivalry-on-the-voice-australia-after-spontaneous-audition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sian Fuller Sparks Sibling Rivalry on 'The Voice Australia' After Spontaneous Audition">&larr;
