As massage therapist Nora Fantry points out, “A good massage helps with range of motion, flexibility, it’s great for your nervous system, and it helps your body relax so when you go back to being active, your muscles contract well. If you’re always contracting your muscles, they can’t function as well as when you also release them.”</p><p>Despite the many benefits and pleasures of massage, though, most people don’t get them regularly. “Cost can be a prohibitive factor for people,” admits Fantry. “And, people often also have fear around being vulnerable or treating themselves to something they think is a luxury item, which can stop them from coming in.” A massage chair, then, can be a great way to get regular massages in the comfort and privacy of your own home. If you’re in the market for a quality one, we’ve rounded up a list of some of the best massage chairs out there.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-massage-chairs>What to consider when buying massage chairs</h2><h3>Consider your pain factors</h3><p>If you’re planning to use your massage chair to treat your pain, consider what type of pain you're experiencing, and make sure your massage chair includes features that will help alleviate it. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nicole Reiss</a>, physical therapist and clinic manager at Potrero Physical Therapy in San Francisco, explains that, “People with arthritis or muscle pain can really benefit from heat. Or as a different example, with a stenosis issue in your lower back, sometimes that patient is more comfortable in a slightly more lumbar-flexed position, so a chair that provides that sort of arch might be more comfortable for that person. So it depends on where and how you’re experiencing the pain.”</p><h3>Style versus substance</h3><p>Some massage chairs are enormous, bulky, or have a high-tech appearance, while others are sleek and designed to fit into the decor of the room. So, when shopping for a massage chair, consider your priorities and space. If you’ve got room to spare, and your top priority is grabbing a chair that’s packed with all the best features, you might want one with a bulkier or more high-tech appearance. But if style is your top priority, there are many chairs available that are beautifully crafted.</p><h3>Partial massage versus full body</h3><p>Some massage chairs are designed to massage the entire body, from feet and calf muscles up to the neck, while other chairs target the full back, or just certain parts of the back. Typically, the higher up the price scale you go, the more full-body massage options you’ll find.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-massage-chairs>Our top picks for the best massage chairs</h2><h3>Best budget massage chair: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Comhoma Recliner Chair Massage Rocker</a></h3><p>Comhoma’s massage chair reclines, rocks, massages, and heats, plus it has a footrest and built-in drink holders.

We then researched the top massage chairs on the market, reading reviews and comparing the list of features against the advice of our experts, and used this information to compile our guide to the best massage chairs for ultimate relaxation.</p><p>If you found this guide useful, you may also be interested in our guides to the <a rel=alternate href=#>best recliners for back pain</a>, the <a rel=alternate href=#>best recliners for neck pain</a>, the overall <a rel=alternate href=#>best recliners</a>, our picks for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best modular sofas</a>, and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy furniture</a>.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-massage-chair>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a massage chair?</h2><p>The biggest advantage of a massage chair is the convenience factor: After the initial upfront investment, a massage chair allows for unlimited free massages in the comfort of your own home.</p><p>On the downside, a massage chair lacks the knowledge and insight of a trained professional. As Fantry explains, “Sometimes when you press down on a place that’s sore, while it might feel good, pressing too hard can actually cause you harm, because it can inflame or irritate something that’s already an issue. So you want to be careful not to overdo it, and if you’re in consistent pain, it might be time to seek out a licensed massage therapist.”</p><h2 id=what-is-a-zero-gravity-massage-chair>What is a zero-gravity massage chair?</h2><p>When it comes to massage chairs, “zero gravity” refers to the chair’s recline position: A zero-gravity chair elevates the feet and reclines the back to take pressure off the spine. It is designed to mimic the weightless feeling of floating in zero-gravity conditions in space. Says Fantry, “It can be helpful for anybody who gets fatigued in their legs, and for people experiencing disc herniation, because it takes some pressure off of their spinal column.” However, people with a history of blood clots or are on blood thinners should check with their doctor before using a zero-gravity massage chair.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-3d-and-4d-massage-chairs>What is the difference between 3D and 4D massage chairs?</h2><p>In a 3D massage chair, the capabilities of the massage rollers are expanded to include an in-and-out motion as well as the traditional up-and-down and side-to-side motions, thereby giving you a three dimensional massage. In a 4D massage chair, those capabilities are expanded one step further: Here, the user controls the movements, enabling a self-directed massage on your exact pain points.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best brand of massage chair?</h3><p>Some great massage chair brands to check out include Osaki, iRest, and Kyoto. You can also take a look at Amazon for massage chairs on both the high and low end of the price scale.</p><h3>Does a massage chair really work?</h3><p>A massage chair can be a great way to relax and alleviate some pain. If you’re not sure whether a massage chair will work for you, try before you buy.</p><h3>How much should I pay for a good massage chair?</h3><p>Budget massage chairs can start as low as $250, but for most models, expect to pay at least $800 for a chair with high-quality, modern features, and a top-of-the-line model might fall between $2,000 and as much as $10,000.</p><h3>How many times a week can you use a massage chair?</h3><p>According to Fantry, “For a professional massage, it’s great to go as often as once a week if you have the means and the time. For a massage chair, if it makes you feel good, you could use it every day, but try not to use it for more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time.”</p><h3>How long do massage chairs last?</h3><p>A high end massage chair should last at least 10 years, and up to 20 years, on average. Be aware that one of the pitfalls of buying a cheaper model is that it may not have the same longevity as a more expensive model would.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnZbAtK3GnmScoJGev7R7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./air-review-1201569677.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Film Review: Air">&larr;
