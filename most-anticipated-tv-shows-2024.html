With so much TV based on IP, there is less room for original ideas brainstormed by creative screenwriters. But 2024 will see a few original series break through, including The Brothers Sun, Death and Other Details, and The Regime. As the delightfully inventive <a href=#>Curb Your Enthusiasm</a> draws to a close after 12 beloved seasons, one must wonder: Is it setting a precedent?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are the TV shows we’re most looking forward to in 2024.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>New Releases</strong></h2><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Brothers Sun</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Jan. 4 on Netflix</strong></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bruce (Sam Song Li) is just a normal guy in California—or at least he wants to be.

Then, she was the head of the criminal gang Tracksuit Mafia, working under the crime lord Wilson Fisk, or Kingpin (Vincent D'Onofrio). Now, Echo, who is deaf, has returned to her Oklahoma hometown. She’s reckoning with her past—which heavily involves Kingpin, her adoptive uncle, who is responsible for her father’s death—and reconnecting with her Native American roots.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Monsieur Spade</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Jan. 14 on AMC</strong></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Based on the 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett—Monsieur Spade picks up where The Maltese Falcon left off.

She is framed as a jack-of-all-trades “queenpin, innovator, mother, and killer,” although the real-life Griselda was ruthlessly violent. Griselda follows its titular character from Medellín, where she shot and killed her husband, to Miami, where she established a massive, bloody cocaine empire.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Masters of the Air</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Jan. 26 on Apple TV+</strong></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Based on Donald L.

But in this version, Donald Glover plays the Mr. in question and Maya Erskine plays the Mrs. Their marriage is a cover story, staged by the mysterious spy agency that both individuals work for.

Based on Juliet McDaniel’s 2018 novel Mr. & Mrs. American Pie, in Palm Royale, one ambitious woman, Maxime Simmons (Wiig), is more of a have-not than a have, but she’s scrambling toward the towering top.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>3 Body Problem</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>March 21 on Netflix</strong></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In physics, a three-body problem takes the positions and velocities of three point masses and solves for their subsequent motion.

At the tail end of Season 2, remember, Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), Penelope’s best friend and Colin’s sister, realized Penelope was Whistledown the whole time.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>House of the Dragon</strong><strong>: Season 2</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Summer on HBO</strong></p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) are at war. In this prequel series set roughly 200 years before Game of Thrones, and based on George R. R. Martin’s book Fire & Blood, House Targaryen has splintered. King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine) has died, and his daughter Rhaenyra is supposed to succeed him. But on his deathbed, he muttered part of a prophet that Alicent, his wife, mistook to believe that their son Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) should be his heir.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Jinx - Part 2</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>TBD on HBO</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eight years after The Jinx, and in the wake of Robert Durst's 2022 death, we’re getting six more docuseries episodes about the convicted murderer and New York real estate heir. The Jinx digs deep into three murders: Durst’s wife Kathie in 1982, the writer Susan Berman in 2000, and Durst’s neighbor Morris Black in 2001. (Durst was suspected of involvement in the first two incidents and confessed to killing Black—though he was acquitted at trial.) And the day before the Season 1 finale, Durst was arrested on first-degree murder charges for the death of Berman.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Bear</strong><strong>: Season 3</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>TBD on FX/Hulu</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Season 3 of this frenetic, chaotic, beautiful show has been confirmed, and filming will resume this winter. In Season 2, Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri)—alongside a dedicated crew of family and friends—raced against the clock to create and open their new restaurant, The Bear. In the finale, Carmy may have accidentally locked himself in the walk-in refrigerator, but opening night ultimately went well, thanks to Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), Natalie (Abby Elliott), and Marcus (Lionel Boyce).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Final Seasons</strong></h2><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Curb Your Enthusiasm</strong><strong>: Season 12</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Feb. 4 on Max</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All good things must come to an end.
